BigDataConsumerInsights_Analysis


Introduction

This repository presents an in-depth analysis of consumer insights derived from big data processing techniques such as Hadoop cluster and Hive processing. The analysis includes trends in consumer complaints, sentiment analysis, and Ngram Text Processing to extract actionable insights from complaint narratives. Leveraging big data technologies, this project aims to provide valuable information about consumer behaviors and trends.

The Dataset

Dataset Name: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Dataset
Dataset URL: Consumer Complaint Database

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dataset captures a wide range of finance-related issues faced by consumers, including fraud, scams, and unfair business practices. Maintained by a U.S. government agency, this dataset covers various companies, regions, and product types, empowering consumers with valuable information to make informed financial decisions.

Project Phases:

Data Ingestion to Hadoop File System (HDFS):
Importing raw data into Hadoop for storage and processing.
Hive Table Creations (Hive Processing):
Creating structured tables in Hive to organize and manage the data.
Data Cleaning using HiveQL:
Applying HiveQL queries to clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
ETL Processing using HiveQL:
Performing Extract, Transform, and Load operations to prepare data for analysis.
Data Analysis:
Conducting comprehensive analysis of the prepared data.
Data Visualization using Tableau & Excel Power Map:
Creating visual representations of the analyzed data for better understanding and insights.
Data Analysis Pointers:

Sentiment Analysis on "Consumer Narrative" Field: Analyzing sentiments expressed in consumer narratives.
NGram Text Processing for "Consumer Narrative" Field: Extracting key phrases and patterns from consumer narratives using NGram analysis.
Overall Complaints Statistics Across the Country:
Identifying most affected companies and their products/services based on complaint data nationwide.
Year-on-Year Growth in Complaints (Q1 2021 to Q1 2023):
Analyzing trends and patterns in complaints over time to understand growth or decline.
Complaints Statistics Across California:
Identifying most affected companies and their products/services specifically in California.
State-Wise Distribution of Complaints:
Visualizing the distribution of complaints across different states for geographical insights.
These phases and analysis pointers will help in deriving meaningful insights from consumer complaints data using big data technologies and analytics tools.
